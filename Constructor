Constructor in C++ is a special method that is invoked automatically at the time of object creation. It is used to initialize the data members of new objects generally.
The constructor in C++ has the same name as the class or structure.It is invoked at the time of object creation. It constructs the values i.e. provides data for the 
object which is why it is known as constructors.


Some characteristics of constructors-

Constructor has the same name as the class it belongs to.


Although it is possible, constructors are often declared in the class's public section. However, this isn't a must.

Because constructors don't return values, they lack a return type.

When we create a class object, the function Object() is immediately invoked.
Over
Declaring a function Object() { [native code] } virtual is not permitted.


One cannot inherit a function Object()

Constructor addresses cannot be referenced to.

When allocating memory, the function Object() makes implicit calls to the new and delete operators.
